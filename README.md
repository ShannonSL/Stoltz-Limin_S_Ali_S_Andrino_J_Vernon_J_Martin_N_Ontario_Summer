# Ontario Tourism
A single page app made up of different modules; promoting our 75 days of summer tourism, with some of the most popular locations for both Canadians and Non-Canadians alike. A promotional video sits front and center to bring attention to the things you can do around Ontario. 
 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need Git.
[See detailed install instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

As well as MAMP or WAMP and MySQL/PHPmyadmin

### Installing

From terminal:

```# Initialize git

$ git init

# Clone this repository

$ git clone https://github.com/ShannonSL/Stoltz-Limin_S_Ali_S_Andrino_J_Vernon_J_Martin_N_Ontario_Summer.git

# Go into the repository

$ cd Stoltz-Limin_S_Ali_S_Andrino_J_Vernon_J_Martin_N_Ontario_Summer.git

```

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd Stoltz-Limin_S_Ali_S_Andrino_J_Vernon_J_Martin_N_Ontario_Summer.git
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. The site will not show properly unless these steps are followed. In development mode, the portfolio needs to be run on a live server (MAMP/WAMP) in order for the database and json to work.
