# Audio/Video App

 An audio / video app built using queries and database assets  A user should be able to log in, filter and select a movie, tv show or audio based on user profile (adult or kids). An API will be built that will let a user comment on the selection, rate it, and share via social media. 
 
## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Youâ€™ll need Git.
[See detailed install instructions here.](https://gist.github.com/derhuerst/1b15ff4652a867391f03)

### Installing

From terminal:

```# Initialize git

$ git init

# Clone this repository

$ git clone https://github.com/smalfoy/Ali_S_AV_App.git

# Go into the repository

$ cd Ali_S_AV_App.git

```

Open the folder in your command line, and install the needed dependencies:

```bash
cd Ali_S_AV_App
npm install
```

Finally, run `npm start` to run the Sass compiler. The site will not show properly unless these steps are followed. In development mode, the portfolio needs to be run on a live server (MAMP/WAMP) in order for the database and json to work.
